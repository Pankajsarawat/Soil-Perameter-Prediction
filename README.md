# Soil-Perameter-Prediction
This internship project at NECTAR involved real-time monitoring and predicting soil parameters like moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity. It utilised microcontrollers for sensor data acquisition and incorporated data preprocessing for a machine learning model, with applications in precision agriculture and sustainable farming.
